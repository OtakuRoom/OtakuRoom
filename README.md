## Introduction

"OtakuRoom" is a software for creating and sharing albums, free and no Ads. It innovatively adopts distributed encryption technology. Users can freely share their creations, all data is encrypted, and would not upload to the server, which fully protects user privacy.

## Install

Install from Microsoft App Store: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/otakuroom/9MXC37MK6069

## Features

##### Create albums

- Optimize the organization of albums: In addition to albums and pictures, we have introduced a scene layer. A scene is composed of one or more related pictures, and a scene tells a moving story. (In the future, it will also support adding short videos, music, text, particle effects and wave effects, etc., and will also support setting scenes as live wallpapers, so stay tuned)
- A lot of optimizations have been made for the ACG: AI face recognition model specially trained for 2D characters; AI image enlargement technology specially designed for ACG pictures; lossless compression algorithm specially designed for ACG pictures.

##### Share album

- Innovatively based on a distributed network, create an album sharing function: decentralized design, no resource server required, and resources are permanently valid!
- Support album download: We encourage you to download the album to the local hard disk, after all, your own is the best.
- Support album sync: After the author updates the album, the album that has been downloaded to the local can also be updated synchronously.

##### Protect privacy

- Protect user privacy: the server will not save unnecessary user information, and the shared creations and user information will be desensitized and cannot be reverse tracked.
- Encrypt Sensitive data: Whether it is a personal local creations or a creation shared on the network, it is encrypted and cannot be read by third-party software.

##### AI technology

- AI face recognition model specially trained for 2D characters.
- AI image upscale technology specially designed for ACG images. Small pictures will not be blurred after upscale.
- Powerful image compression technology: It can identify similar images based on image features, and combine and compress similar images, which greatly improves the image compression rate.
